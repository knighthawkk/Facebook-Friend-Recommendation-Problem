# Facebook-Friend-Recommendation-Problem
Given a directed social graph, have to predict missing links to recommend users (Link Prediction in graph)

Worked on this Kaggle dataset provided by Facebook

The dataset had 1.85M+ rows.
This was a challenge as it was completely out of domain for me.

Applied various Feature Engineering methods by studying various Link Prediction Algorithms and added multiple features to it which directly contributed in increasing the model performance.

Some of the features were created using Matrix Factorizations and methods like SVD(Singular Value Decomposition)

Applied various ML Models and boosting techniques such as XGBoost and was able to bring the Test Performance to 93% and Train Performance to 99.996%
